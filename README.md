# odinproject-landingpage

For this project I gotta make a website that looks like the one in the picture from the odin project (https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png), I think it will be kinda easy, I can already see how to start it off with flexbox with column direction since it can make hte header and footer and the 3 sections of the page. Then I can also use flexbox in all the sections. I can use it to make the cards and to center the text and stuff. I dont think this will take me long but let's see!!!
